### Description of your website, including:

- ### Purpose : 

  The purpose of the **Cleaning and Laundry Management System** website is to accept a laundry order from the customer and manage the order, such as organising the schedule delivery, sending confirmation of order, and accepting payments. The benefits are getting all customer order recorded automatically, well organised, and never miss out or lost any order.

  In today's condition of COVID-19 pandemic where we need to keep distance to each other to minimalise contact, all business is required to use Internet technology to reach out to their customer. This includes businesses who provide services of cleaning and laundry. At the moment, people acquire their services via call, submit an enquire via their static website and need to wait for the admin to send a reply. Then, the admin recorded the job order manually. The process is semi-manual and often the admin forget to reply to the customer enquiry or miss the call. This has resulted bad experience for the potential customer and it is consider as lost from business aspect.

  Apart from giving a better management system for the admin of the business, it boost the client experience in booking their preferred service. 

  There are two users type in this website, customer and admin. 

  Important things for the customer :

  1. Guide of what needs to do to order the services
  2. Confirmation of order. Keep the customer informed that their order is received and being processed.
  3. Update of the job order status. It is very important to keep customer updated and active communication implies professioanlism of the business.

  Important things for the administrator :

  1. Filter of pending jobs that needs admin to take action so they do not miss out on any job request received 
  2. List out all of the future jobs. It displays all scheduled jobs
  3. Details of each job. Show the customer details, when, and where the jobs take place.
